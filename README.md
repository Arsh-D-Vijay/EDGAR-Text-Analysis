# EDGAR-Text-Analysis
This project is the text analysis of EDGAR financial report dataset availabled online.
Here I have performed text analysis on specific section (“Management's Discussion and Analysis”, 
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, and “Risk Factors”) of EDGAR report available at web.
Then for these section I have found the following features:
1: Positive score, negative score, polarity score
2: Average Sentence Length, percentage of complex words, fog index
4: Complex word count
5: Word count
6: Uncertainity
7: Constraining
8: Positive and Negative ratio
9: uncertainity and Constraining ratio
10: Constraining words whole report

for the purpose of extraction specific sections from whole report, I have used Regular Expression (REGEX).
