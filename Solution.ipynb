   in november 1996, the company initiated a major restructuring and growthplan designed to substantially reduce its cost structure and grow the businessin order to restore higher levels of profitability for the company. by july1997, the company completed the major phases of the restructuring plan. the$225.0 million of annualized cost savings anticipated from the restructuringresults primarily from the consolidation of administrative functions within thecompany, the rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities(including a reduction in the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 andwarehouses from 61 to 18), the elimination of over 6,000 positions (including3,300 from the divestiture of non-core businesses described below andapproximately 2,800 other positions), the centralization of the company\\'sprocurement function and re-negotiation of supply contracts resulting inprocurement savings for raw materials, components and sourced finished productsand the reduction of the company\\'s product offerings and stock keeping units(\"sku\\'s\"). the restructuring and growth plan also included a redefinition of thecompany\\'s core product categories and the elimination of those businesses andproduct lines that did not fit the core categories. sunbeam\\'s core productcategories are appliances, health at home, personal care and comfort, outdoorcooking and away from home. product categories and businesses determined to benon-core were divested in 1997, including the company\\'s furniture business andits time and temperature, decorative bedding and counselor/registered trademark/and borg/registered trademark/ scale product lines. in addition, the companysold its textile mill in biddeford, maine in 1997.     net sales from continuing operations for 1997 were $1,168.2 million, anincrease of $183.9 million or 18.7% over 1996. net sales on a normalized basis,after excluding divested product lines which are not classified as discontinuedoperations (time and temperature products, decorative bedding andcounselor/registered trademark/ and borg/registered trademark/ branded scales),increased 22.4% during the year.     global sales, on a normalized basis, increased during 1997 in all five ofthe company\\'s product categories primarily from new product introductions,improved distribution (particularly with the company\\'s top ten customers),international geographic expansion and improved price realization for certainproducts. global sales growth on a normalized basis exceeded 25% in theappliance, outdoor cooking and away from home categories with sales increasesof 26.8%, 27.2% and 28.6%, respectively. sales in the health at home categoryincreased 10.7% on a normalized basis and sales in the personal care andcomfort category increased 3.4% during 1997.     the company\\'s appliance category sales increases were driven by newproducts, such as re-designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deepfryers and toasters, and by increased distribution with large national massretailers. sales of outdoor cooking products increased in 1997 after threestraight years of declines as a result of increased merchandising andadvertising programs, new distribution and the introduction of an entirely newline of grills and accessories for the 1998 season that began to ship in thefourth quarter of 1997 under a new \"early buy\" marketing program that includedamong other things, extended credit terms with due dates in the second quarterof 1998. the company sold approximately $50.0 million of outdoor cookingproducts under this program in the fourth quarter of 1997. the early buy programfor outdoor cooking products is designed to improve customer service levels andproduction efficiencies with more level seasonal production and distributionactivities that have historically peaked in the first half of each year and todrive additional retail sell-through of outdoor cooking products by reducing thelikelihood of retail stock-outs during the important first and second quarter1998 selling season.     sales of personal care and comfort products were up over 30% throughseptember 1997, but suffered during the fourth quarter as a result of lowerthan expected retail sell through of electric blankets in key northern marketsin late 1997 coupled with the inability to service demand for king and queensized blankets due to shortages of blanket shells. the company anticipatesshifting to a more                                       14level production for blankets in 1998 in order to more adequately service theseasonal demand for bedding products. health at home category sales increasedas a result of new products and improved distribution in the drug channels.away from home sales increased in 1997 as a result of new products, includingcordless clippers and titanium blades coupled with increased distribution ofcommercially rated appliances. also contributing to the company\\'s sales growthin 1997 were its new retail outlet stores, of which 22 were open by the end of1997.     international sales, which represented 21% of total revenues in 1997, grew31.2% during the year. this sales growth was driven primarily by 54 new 220volt product introductions and the execution of 25 new internationaldistribution and license agreements. revenue growth of approximately 34% wasachieved both in mexico and by the company\\'s latin american export salesorganization, and sales in venezuela and canada increased approximately 23%each. european sales fell slightly in 1997, however the company expects thatexpanded electric blanket and clipper sales along with the help of additionalnew distribution agreements will benefit european sales in 1998.     the gross margin percentage for 1997 increased 19.8 percentage points to28.3%. this increase reflects the results of many cost savings and marginenhancement initiatives undertaken as part of the company\\'s restructuring plancoupled with the incremental margin attributable to new products and higherrevenues associated with the company\\'s growth plan. the company initiated amanufacturing refinement program in the second quarter of 1997 targeted ataggressively improving factory productivity at all of its remaining operations,including the neosho, missouri outdoor cooking products facility which sufferedfrom poor productivity and operating inefficiencies during the 1997 grillseason. the benefits of the refinement program began to favorably impactfactory productivity in several factories during the third quarter of 1997. therefinement of the neosho facility, which was completed prior to the initiationof production for the 1998 grill season in the fourth quarter, included arevised plant layout to improve material flow, increased usage of common partsin the manufacturing process and modifications to the paint system to increasecapacity and throughput.     operating earnings for 1997 were $199.4 million, an increase of $195.0million over 1996, excluding the impact of the 1996 special charge. as apercentage of sales, the operating margin of 17.1% increased 16.6 percentagepoints above last year\\'s operating margin, excluding 1996 special charges. theoperating margin improvements for 1997 were the result of the improved grossmargin discussed above and lower selling, general and administrative (\"sg&a\")costs in 1997 associated with the consolidation of six divisional and regionalheadquarters into one corporate headquarters and one administrative operationscenter, reduced staffing levels, the outsourcing of certain administrative anddistribution functions, a reduction in the number of warehouses, and companywide cost control initiatives. in addition, sg&a during 1996 includedincremental compensation costs associated with restricted stock awards andother costs related to the employment of a new senior management team, higherthan normal expenditures for market research, packaging and other initiativesrelated to the launch of the company\\'s growth plan, and higher bad debtexpenses associated with certain of the company\\'s customers. the cost reductioninitiatives and one time items in 1996 coupled with increased sales in 1997resulted in sg&a decreasing as a percentage of sales from 17.4% in 1996(excluding the impact of special charges) to 11.2% for 1997.     interest expense decreased from $13.6 million in 1996 to $11.4 million in1997 primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in 1997 due toimproved cash flows.     the effective income tax of 35% for 1997 and 1996 for earnings (loss) fromcontinuing operations was lower than the statutory federal and state rates as aresult of lower foreign taxes from the utilization of foreign tax credits andloss carryforwards and lower state income taxes as a result of certain stateincome tax credits.     the company\\'s diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was$1.41 per share versus a loss per share from continuing operations in 1996 of$2.37. the company\\'s share base utilized in the diluted earnings per sharecalculation increased approximately 6% during 1997 as a result of an increasein the number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalentsoutstanding due to the exercise of stock options and a higher market value ofthe company\\'s common stock in 1997.                                       15     the company\\'s discontinued furniture operations, which were sold in march1997, had revenues of $51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to thesale and break-even earnings. in 1996, the discontinued furniture operationshad net income of $.8 million on revenues of $227.5 million and an estimatedloss on disposal of the business of $32.4 million, net of applicable income taxbenefits. the sale of the company\\'s furniture business assets (primarilyinventory, property, plant and equipment) was completed in march 1997.     the company received $69 million in cash and retained accounts receivablerelated to the furniture business of approximately $50.0 million as of theclosing date. the final purchase price for the furniture business was subjectto a post-closing adjustment based on the terms of the asset purchase agreementand in the first quarter of 1997, after completion of the sale, the companyrecorded an additional loss on disposal of $13.7 million, net of income taxbenefits. see discussion of restructuring, impairment and other costs in note 8and discontinued operations and assets held for sale in note 9 to the company\\'sconsolidated financial statements for further information regarding theindividual components of the 1996 special charge and details of the 1997activity in the company\\'s restructuring accrual.year ended december 29, 1996 compared to the year ended december 31, 1995     the company\\'s operating results for 1996 include the effects of a pre-taxspecial

operations of $984.2 million for 1996 representsa decrease of $32.7 million, or 3.2%, from 1995. the company experienced a lossfrom continuing operations of $196.7 million or $2.37 per share for 1996 versusearnings from continuing operations of $37.6 million or $.45 per share(diluted) in 1995 primarily as a result of the restructuring activitiesdiscussed above. the net loss for 1996 was $228.3 million, or $2.75 per share,compared to net earnings of $50.5 million, or $0.61 per share (diluted), for1995. excluding the impact of special charge items for 1996, earnings fromcontinuing operations before income taxes decreased from $60.6 million in 1995to a loss of $12.9 million in 1996.     domestic sales represented approximately 80% of total sales of the companyin 1996 and decreased $28.5 million or 3.4% from 1995. this sales decline wasdriven by lower sales of outdoor cooking products, which declined 7.3% andlower sales of bedding products which declined 9.0% from 1995, primarily asresult of lower decorative bedding sales (divested in december 1996). domesticsales of appliance products were flat with sales increases from new productssuch as vegetable steamers and toaster ovens being offset by reduced pricing onbreadmakers. sales of other product categories such as health and personal careproducts and time and temperature products (divested in march 1997) were eitherflat or declined slightly from 1995 levels.     international sales decreased $4.2 million or 2.2% from 1995 primarily asa result of lower sales in latin america due to political and/or economicinstability in several countries such as ecuador, peru, columbia and venezuela(which suffered a bolivar devaluation in april 1996), a sales decline of 11.2%                                       16in canada as a result of the bankruptcy filing of the company\\'s then largestcanadian customer offset by a 55.0% increase in sales in mexico as a result ofa more stable economic environment in 1996.     the company\\'s gross margin percentage, excluding the impact of specialcharges, was 17.9% of sales in 1996, down from 20.4% in 1995, primarily fromthe underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and excess manufacturingcapacity that has been realigned for 1997 and beyond by the company\\'srestructuring and growth plan cost reduction initiatives.     selling, general and administrative (\"sg&a\") expenses, excluding theimpact of special charges described above, were 17.6% of sales in 1996primarily as a result of an inflated cost structure that has been realigned for1997 and beyond. in addition, a $12.0 million fourth quarter 1996 mediaadvertising campaign and one-time expenditures for market research, newpackaging, and other growth plan initiatives resulted in higher than normalsg&a spending in 1996. also included in 1996 sg&a costs were $7.7 million ofcompensation expense resulting from restricted stock awards made in connectionwith the employment of a new senior management team.     interest expense for 1996 increased from $9.4 million in 1995 to $13.6million as a result of increased indebtedness of the company for workingcapital requirements and non-recurring capitalized interest in 1995 related tothe construction of the hattiesburg manufacturing and distribution center.     the effective income tax rate for 1996 decreased 3 percentage points from1995 to 35.0% as a result of certain foreign and state operating losses forwhich no tax benefits were recorded and the non-deductibility of compensationexpense related to restricted stock awards.     the company\\'s discontinued furniture operations had revenues of $227.5million in 1996, up 22.6% from $185.6 million in 1995. this revenue growth wasthe result of the acquisition of the samsonite/registered trademark/ furniturebusiness in november 1995. excluding the impact of this acquisition, furniturebusiness sales declined 2.1%. earnings from the discontinued furnitureoperations, net of taxes, declined from $12.9 million in 1995 to $.8 million in1996 primarily as a result of lower gross margins from reduced pricing,underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and higher raw material costs. inaddition, sg&a costs increased due to the inclusion of the samsonite/registeredtrademark/ furniture business, higher distribution and warehousing costs,particularly with resin furniture products and higher bad debt expenses.foreign operations     during 1997 approximately 90% of the company\\'s business was conducted inu.s. dollars (including both domestic sales, u.s. dollar denominated exportsales primarily to certain latin american markets, asian sales and the majorityof european sales). the company\\'s exposure to market risk from changes inforeign currency and interest rates is generally insignificant. the company\\'snon-u.s. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries inmexico, venezuela and canada. venezuela is considered a hyperinflationaryeconomy for accounting purposes for 1995, 1996 and 1997 and mexico reverted tohyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997; therefore, translationadjustments related to venezuelan and mexican net monetary assets are includedas a component of net earnings. such translation adjustments were not materialto 1995, 1996 and 1997 operating results.     on a limited basis, the company selectively uses derivatives (foreignexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposuresthat arise in the normal course of business. no derivative contracts areentered into for trading or speculative purposes. the use of derivatives didnot have a material impact on the company\\'s financial results in 1995, 1996 and1997. see note 4 to the company\\'s consolidated financial statements.liquidity and capital resources     as of december 28, 1997, the company had cash and cash equivalents of$52.4 million and total debt of $195.2 million. cash used in operatingactivities during 1997 was $8.2 million compared to $14.2                                       17million provided by operating activities in 1996. this decrease is primarilyattributable to an increase in earnings before non-cash charges in 1997 and theutilization of tax benefits generated from the implementation of the company\\'srestructuring plan, offset by higher accounts receivable due to increased salesin 1997 and certain seasonal dating terms, increased inventory levels in 1997necessary to support continued anticipated sales growth and the company\\'sinitiatives to improve customer service levels and 1997 cash expendituresrequired to implement the restructuring plan. in addition, cash used inoperating activities reflects $59 million of proceeds from the sale of tradeaccounts receivable under the company\\'s revolving trade accounts receivablesecuritization program entered into in december 1997 as more fully described innote 3 to the company\\'s consolidated financial statements.     capital spending totaled $58.3 million in 1997 and was primarily for newproducts, cost reduction and capacity expansion initiatives. capital spendingin 1996 was $75.3 million (including $14.5 million related to the discontinuedfurniture operations) and was primarily attributable to new productdevelopment, cost reduction initiatives and a $5.0 million warehouse expansionfinanced with a capital lease. capital spending in 1995 reflected approximately$59.4 million associated with the hattiesburg facility, $27.4 million relatedto new product development and $10.8 million attributable to the discontinuedfurniture business. the remaining 1995 capital spending was related to costreduction projects, productivity initiatives and environmental complianceincluding $14.4 million for a powder coat paint system for outdoor cookingproducts. the company anticipates 1998 capital spending to be approximately 5%of sales and primarily related to new product introductions, capacity additionsand certain facility rationalization initiatives.     cash provided by investing activities also reflects $91.0 million inproceeds from sales of businesses, assets and product categories determined tobe non-core to the company\\'s ongoing operations in conjunction with the 1996restructuring plan. cash used in investing activities for 1995 includes thepurchase of a portion of the company\\'s furniture business, which wassubsequently divested in full in march 1997.     cash provided by financing activities totaled $16.4 million in 1997 andreflects net borrowings of $5.0 million under the company\\'s revolving creditfacility, $12.2 million of debt repayments related to the divested furnitureoperations and other assets sold and $26.6 million in cash proceeds from theexercise of stock options, substantially all by former employees of thecompany. in 1996, cash provided by financing activities of $45.3 million wasprimarily from increased revolving credit facility borrowings to supportworking capital and capital spending requirements, $11.5 million in newissuances of long-term debt and $4.6 million in proceeds from the sale oftreasury shares to certain executives of the company. in july 1997, the companyreduced the amount of available borrowings under its september 1996 unsecuredfive year revolving credit facility from $500 million to $250 million.     the company is a party to various environmental proceedings, substantiallyall related to previously divested operations. in connection with the company\\'srestructuring plan a comprehensive review of environmental exposures wasundertaken and the company accelerated its strategy for the resolution andsettlement of certain environmental claims. this review and change in strategyresulted in additional environmental reserves being recorded in 1996 as morefully described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. inmanagement\\'s opinion, the ultimate resolution of these environmental matterswill not have a material adverse effect upon the company\\'s financial condition.     on march 2, 1998, the company announced the signing of definitiveagreements to acquire the coleman company, inc., signature brands usa, inc. andfirst alert, inc. completion of the acquisitions, which is expected in thesecond quarter of 1998, is contingent on customary conditions, includingregulatory approvals, and acquisition debt issuances. in connection with theacquisitions, the company plans to refinance existing revolving and term debt ofthe acquired companies as well as all or substantially all of its existinglong-term debt. the company expects to finance the cash portion of theacquisitions and all debt refinancings through a combination of new revolvingand term credit facilities and zero coupon notes that will be issued concurrentwith the acquisition closings. refer to note 14 for additional informationregarding the pending acquisitions.     the company believes its cash flow from operations, existing cash and cashequivalent balances, its receivable securitization program, with the proceeds ofthe anticipated new debt financings discussed above will be sufficient tosupport working capital needs, capital spending, debt service and acquisitionrelated cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
